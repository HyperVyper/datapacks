## Getting Started

Every folder in here is its own datapack. Datapack specific information can be found inside these datapacks.

### Installing

Its easy.

Move the datapack(s) you wish to use inside your "datapacks" folder of your save file found in `.minecraft\saves`.

```
C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\<world name>\datapacks
```

Now just join the world you put the datapacks in and execute the following command:

```
/datapack enable <name of the added datapack>
```
A "loaded"-text should appear, assuring you that its up and running.

Have fun trying out the new stuff you have added!

## Version

These datapacks were created in Minecraft 1.13.X, they might be working in newer versions of Minecraft.
