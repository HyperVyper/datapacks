# Metroites Datapacks

These are my datapacks for Minecraft which I have coded and now also published. (.mcfunction not Java)

## Getting Started

Every folder in here is its own datapack. Datapack specific information can be found inside these datapacks.

### Installing

Its easy.

Move the datapack you wish to use inside your "datapacks" folder of your wished save file.

```
C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\<world name>\datapacks
```

Now just load your save file in you Minecraft client and execute the following command:

```
/datapack enable <name of the added datapack>
```

Have fun trying out the new stuff you've added!

## Version

These datapacks were created in 1.13, they might be working with newer versions of Minecraft.
