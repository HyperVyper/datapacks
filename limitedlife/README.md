## limitedlife

limitedlife limits your max health every time you die. Max health can be restored if a *Bat Wing* is thrown into a water filled cauldron under an End Crystal. The "Absorption" effect will be needed!
Also allows you to craft a different kind of Elytra (tip: burns on daylight) and allows you to build [ventilators](https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/master/ventilators%5BSTANDALONE%5D)! (ventilators[STANDALONE] is included)
Recommended to use with graves, loud2x2tnt and sapphire.
