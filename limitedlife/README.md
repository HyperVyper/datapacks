## limitedlife

limitedlife limits your max health every time you die. Max health can be restored if a *Bat Wing* is thrown into a water-filled cauldron under an End Crystal. The "Absorption" effect will be needed!
Also, craft a different kind of Elytra using *Bat Wings* (tip: burns on daylight, tip2: "Milk Bucket" recipe book entry)!
Recommended to use with graves, loud2x2tnt, ventilators and sapphire.
